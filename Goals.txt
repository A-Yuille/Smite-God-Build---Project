God Builder (Name Placeholder)
Smite is a M.O.B.A that has many playable characters that each require building items throughout the course of a match. 
These items may vary per god (playable character) therefore it can be hard for a player to choose a build that is effective especially with the shifting “META” of builds as patches adjust items efficacy. 
-The goal of this project is to produce a suggested build for a all gods that is based on most used builds by the community.
-Produce a build for each god that is based on statistics gathered through Smite API
-The build updates as statistics change.


Details:
Builds chosen are based on winrate. Each item slot will present the top options sorted by win rate and highest usage in each slot
